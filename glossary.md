## 8-puzzle

**8-puzzle** consists of a 3x3 grid containing 8 numbered tiles and a blank space. A tile adjacent to the blank space can slide into that space. The object is to reach a specified **goal state** from a given **initial state**.

# A

## absolute error

Magnitude of the difference between the theoretical value (expected value) and the actual value of a physical quantity.

## abstraction

Abstraction is selecting data from a larger pool to show only the relevant details to the object.

## abstraction hierarchy

It hides the complexity of the system and allows individuals to work on different modules of the hierarchy at the same time.

## accessibility relations

In modal logic, an accessibility relation R is a binary relation such that R⊆ W×W where W is a set of possible worlds. The accessibility relation determines for each world w ∈ W which worlds ẃ are accessible from w.

## action monitoring

Checking the preconditions of each action as it is executed, rather than checking the preconditions of the entire remaining plan.

## action schema

## action-utility function

## actions

The things that an agent can do. We model this with a function, **Actions(s)**, that returns a collection of actions
that the agent can execute in state *s*.

## activation

## activation function

A mathematical function that transforms the input or set of inputs received at a neuron to produce an output.
Popular examples include the Sigmoid function, Rectificied Linear Units (ReLU) and Hyperbolic Tangent (Tanh)

## active learning

An active learning agent decided which actions to take in order to guide its learning: it values leearning new things
as well as reaping immediate rewards from the environment.
This is in contrast to a passive learning agent, which learns from its observations, but the actions the agent takes are not influenced by the learning process.

## actor

## adaptive dynamic programming

Also known as Approximate Dynamic Programming; it is a type of Reinforcement Learning where local rewards and transitions depend on unknown parameters - we set an initial control policy and update it until it converges to an optimal control policy.

## add list

## admissible heuristic

A **heuristic** is a function that scores alternatives at each branching in a search algorithm. An **admissible heuristic** is one that *never overestimates* the cost to reach the goal. Admissible heuristics are **optimistic** in nature as they believe the cost of reaching the goal is less than it actually is.

## adversarial search

Traversing a tree data structure to find all possible moves. It is usually used in a two-player game; each available move is represented using gain and loss for an individual player. An important application of it is in zero sum games, as in those games, one players' loss is the other players' gain.

## adversary argument

## agent

An **agent** is anything that can be viewed as perceiving its **environment** through **sensors** and acting upon that environment through **actuators**.

## agent function

An agent's behavior is described by the **agent function** that maps any given percept sequence to an action.

## agent program

_Internally,_ the agent function for an artificial agent will be implemented by an **agent program**.

## agglomerative clustering

It is a category of hierarchical clustering which uses a bottom-up approach. All observations start in their own cluster and different pairs of clusters are merged as you move up levels in the hierarchy. Its results are represented using a dendrogram.

## aggregation

## algorithm

An **algorithm** is a sequence of **unambiguous finite steps** that when carried out on a given problem produce the expected outcome and terminate in **finite time**.

## alignment method

## alpha-beta

**alpha** (**&alpha;**) is the value of the best (i.e., highest-value) choice we have found so far at any choice point along the path for MAX and **beta**(**&beta;**) is the value of the best (i.e., lowest-value) choice we have found so far at any choice point along the path for MIN in a standard minimax tree.

## alpha-beta pruning

**alpha—beta pruning** is applied to a standard minimax tree to prune away branches that cannot possibly influence the final minimax decision.

## ambient illumination

## ambiguity

It is the state of being uncertain or doubtful.

## ambiguity aversion

Ambiguity aversion (also known as uncertainty aversion) is a preference for known risks over unknown risks.

## analogical reasoning

Analogical reasoning is any type of thinking that relies upon an analogy. An analogical argument is an explicit representation of a form of analogical reasoning that cites accepted similarities between two systems to support the conclusion that some further similarity exists.

## anchoring effect

It is a type of cognitive bias which makes people focus on the first piece of information (the "anchor") that was given to them, to make decisions. To explain this with an example; when buying a product if you're told a high price by the seller, your mind estimates the worth of that product as that initial/anchor price you're told, and then when you're offered a discount on it, you are more inclined to buy it thinking that you're getting it for cheap.

## And-Elimination

In propositional logic, conjunction elimination (also called and elimination, ∧ elimination, or simplification0 is a valid immediate inference, argument form and rule of inference which makes the inference that, if the conjunction A and B is true, then A is true, and B is true. The rule makes it possible to shorten longer proofs by deriving one of the conjuncts of a conjunction on a line by itself.

## AND-parallelism

In parallel logic programming, AND-parallelism is one of the two types of of parallelism. In AND-parallelism, the portions of conjunctive goal are pursued in parallel.

## architecture

It is a very broad term; however, it is generally used to refer to the structure of the buildings and other constructions.

## arity

In logic, mathematics, and computer science, the arity of a function or operation is the number of arguments or operands that the function takes.

## Asilomar Principles
The Asilomar Conference on Beneficial AI was a conference organized by the Future of Life Institute, held January 5-8, 2017, at the Asilomar Conference Grounds in California. More than 100 thought leaders and researches in economics, law, ethics, and philosophy met at the conference, to address and formulate principles of beneficial AI. Its outcome was the creation of a set of guidelines for AI research – the 23 Asilomar AI Principles.

## assignment

## associative memory

In terms of Psychology, it is the type of memory which allows us to remember things by finding links between, apparently, unrelated things. To explain with an example; remembering someones' name by the dress they wore the first time you met them. Clearly, these two things seem completely unrelated.

# B

## back-propagation

**back-propagation** is an algorithm used for *supervised learning* of **artificial neural networks** using gradient descent.
The method calculates the gradient of a given error function with respect to the weights of the network. The "backward" terminology stems because the gradient calculation requires backward propagation through the newtork.

## backed-up value
## backgammon

Backgammon is one of the oldest known board games. It is a two player game where each player has fifteen pieces (checkers) which move between twenty-four triangles (points) according to the roll of two dice. The objective of the game is to be first to bear off, i.e. move all fifteen checkers off the board.

## background subtraction

Foreground detection is one of the major tasks in the field of computer vision and image processing whose aim is to detect changes in image sequences. Background subtraction is any technique which allows an image's foreground to be extracted for further processing (object recognition etc.).

## backjumping
## backmarking
## backoff model
## backpropagation

To minimize the cost function, we need to know how the changes in weights and biases affect the cost function i.e. partial derivatives of the cost function w.r.t every weight and bias in the network; back propagation is a method that allows us to quickly compute all these partial derivatives.

## Backus-Naur form (BNF)

A mathematical notation used to describe the syntax of a programming language.  

## backward-chaining

## bag of words

The **bag of words** model is a simplifying representation used in natural language processing and information retrieval. Also known as the vector space model. In this model, a text is represented as the bag of its words, disregarding grammar and even word order but keeping multiplicity.

## bagging

Bagging (stands for **B**ootstrap **Agg**regat**ing**) is a way to decrease the variance of your prediction by generating additional data for training from your original dataset using combinations with repetitions to produce multisets of the same cardinality/size as your original data. By increasing the size of your training set you can't improve the model predictive force, but just decrease the variance, narrowly tuning the prediction to expected outcome.

## bang-bang control
## baseline
## batch gradient descent
## Bayes' rule

**Bayes' rule** describes the probabilty of an event(lets say A) in the light of that a given event B has already occured.
Mathematically Bayes' rule can be described as :-  **P(A|B) = P(A)P(B|A)/P(B)**

## Bayes-Nash equilibrium
## Bayesian learning

A Machine Learning method which enables us to encode our initial perception of what a model should look like, regardless of what the data tells us. It proves to be very useful when there’s a sparse amount of data to train our model properly.

## Bayesian network

A probabilistic graphical model representing a group of variables along with their conditional dependencies through a direct acyclic graph; it is also used to compute the probability distribution for a subset of network variables, provided the distributions or values of any subset of the remaining variables.

## beam search

Beam search is a heuristic search algorithm that explores a graph by expanding the most promising node in a limited set. Beam search is an optimization of best-first search that reduces its memory requirements. Best-first search is a graph search which orders all partial solutions (states) according to some heuristic. But in beam search, only a predetermined number of best partial solutions are kept as candidates.[1] It is thus a greedy algorithm.

## boid

Boids is an artificial life program, developed by Craig Reynolds in 1986, which simulates the flocking behaviour of birds. His paper on this topic was published in 1987 in the proceedings of the ACM SIGGRAPH conference. The name "boid" corresponds to a shortened version of "bird-oid object", which refers to a bird-like object.

## boosting

Boosting is a two-step approach, where one first uses subsets of the original data to produce a series of averagely performing models and then "boosts" their performance by combining them together using a particular cost function (=majority vote). Unlike bagging, in the classical boosting the subset creation is not random and depends upon the performance of the previous models: every new subsets contains the elements that were (likely to be) misclassified by previous models.

## checkers
## chess

Chess is a two-player strategy board game played on a chessboard, a checkered gameboard with 64 squares arranged in an 8×8 grid. Play does not involve hidden information. Each player begins with 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. Each of the six piece types moves differently, with the most powerful being the queen and the least powerful the pawn. The objective is to checkmate the opponent's king by placing it under an inescapable threat of capture. To this end, a player's pieces are used to attack and capture the opponent's pieces, while supporting each other.

## Chomsky Normal Form

A grammar is in **Chomsky Normal Form (usually found as CNF)** if all its production rules are in one of the following forms:

A -> a
S -> ε
```

where `S` is the starting symbol and `ε` the symbol for the empty string.

## fuzzy control
A fuzzy control system is a control system based on fuzzy logic—a mathematical system that analyzes analog input values in terms of logical variables that take on continuous values between 0 and 1, in contrast to classical or digital logic, which operates on discrete values of either 1 or 0 (true or false, respectively).

## fuzzy logic

Fuzzy logic is a form of many-valued logic in which the truth values of variables may be any real number between 0 and 1. It is employed to handle the concept of partial truth, where the truth value may range between completely true and completely false.

## fuzzy set theory

Fuzzy sets (aka uncertain sets) are somewhat like sets whose elements have degrees of membership. In classical set theory, the membership of elements in a set is assessed in binary terms according to a bivalent condition — an element either belongs or does not belong to the set. By contrast, fuzzy set theory permits the gradual assessment of the membership of elements in a set; this is described with the aid of a membership function valued in the real unit interval [0, 1].

## game theory

Game theory is the study of mathematical models of strategic interaction between rational decision-makers. It has applications in all fields of social science, as well as in logic and computer science. Originally, it addressed zero-sum games, in which one person's gains result in losses for the other participants. Today, game theory applies to a wide range of behavioral relations, and is now an umbrella term for the science of logical decision making in humans, animals, and computers.

**Speech recognition** is the process of analyzing audio and ***recognizing*** parts related to speech within the audio file. This process of ***recognition*** may involve simply identifying the speech part, gender identification and also as complex as identifying the words spoken when given an audio. This field often overlaps into the domain of artificial intelligence and machine learning.

## zero-sum games

In game theory and economic theory, a **zero-sum game** is a mathematical representation of a situation in which each participant's gain or loss of utility is exactly balanced by the losses or gains of the utility of the other participants. If the total gains of the participants are added up and the total losses are subtracted, they will sum to zero.
